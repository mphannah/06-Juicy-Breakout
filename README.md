# 06-Juicy-Breakout

I have provided a simple, generic brick breaker game, built in Godot. You can use the presentation as a guide or use your own imagination, but your assignment is to make the game feel more "juicy": kinetic, reactive, physical.

- Changed the color of the paddle, ball and tiles
- Animated how tiles and paddle come on screen
